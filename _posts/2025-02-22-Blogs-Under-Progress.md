subtitle: 3 blogs are due by April, 2025
---

Currently I am learning about 3 major topics and working on their respective blogs. Most probably I will publish them by April, 2025.

Topics are:
- Statistical Mechanics
- Hopfield Network
- Boltzmann Machine

My current goal is to master the literature of object centric learning and compositionality so that I can contribute in this field. This is the reason I chose the above topics and also how I will choose future blog topics. 

Future Topics might be:
- RBM
- Topics in Generative models 
- Topics in Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM)
- Disentangled Representation Learning
- And so on...


Fun Fact:\\
In [September 2024](https://github.com/joshi98kishan/deciphering-hopfield-network/blob/1475cb7d8a679f91cf78e58c8570166700383dff/README.md){:target="_blank"}, I decided to study Hopfield Network and Boltzmann Machine  and on [8th october, 2024](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/prize-announcement/){:target="_blank"}, Noble Prize in Physics was announced and it was given to the creators of these two models.
